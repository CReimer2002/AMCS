    /*
        Map features in this sim are a way of identifying and simulating a specific location's attributes and how those will affect attacks, defenses or logistical movement through those regions. Location types are used to approximate the topography of the area for calculating defensibility and ease of movement. Area priorities are a backend means of determining what zone should be used when one zone falls inside another one. Ownership is used to approximate how the population of an area is supposed to react to a unit being based there. Unlike types or priorities, ownership is malleable and if an area falls under new ownership, the ownership number will fluctuate. 
        // AREA TYPES/LOCATION TYPES //

            0: grassland with very little cover
            1: rural with few buildings
            2: rural area with buildings
            3: vineyards/tall fields/farmland
            4: forest, dense
            5: industrial facility
            6: airfield
            7: military base
            8: urban area with many houses
            9: highly developed city
            10: rural with buildings and lots of forest

        // AREA PRIORITIES //

            1: first priority. Always used when unit is in zone.
            2: 2nd priority. Will not be used if a unit is in it's zone but that zone also falls in the zone of a higher priority area.
            3: 3rd priority, Will not be used if a unit is in it's zone but that zone also falls in the zone of a higher priority area. 

        // AREA OWNERSHIP //

            7: very strongly held by Georgia. Area has well-dug in units dedicated to it's defense and will also likely have partisan activity after the main units are defeated.
            6: fairly strongly held by Georgia. No military units directly assigned to that area's defense but will likely have partisan activity and a populace that may aid future SOF operations.
            5: moderately held by Georgia. Some partisan activity, protests expected. Will quickly be placated when presented with overwhelming forces.
            4: held by Georgia but not very strongly. Either little Georgian resistance potential or few Georgian locals at all. 
            3: neutral or uninhabited. 
            2: some Abkahzian sympathies or at least placated by Abkhazian forces
            1: moderately held by Abkhazia. Locals are either unconcerned or moderately supportive of the Occupation. Alternatively there are a moderate number of Abkhaz forces making patrols of the area.
            0: Strongly held by Abkhazia. Partisans, leftover Georgian forces and guerillas have been rooted out. Strong Abkhaz presence and with well dug in units.
